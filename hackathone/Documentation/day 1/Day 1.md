🌟 Step 1: Marketplace Type Selection
Selected Marketplace Type: General E-Commerce
Reason for Selection:
I’ve chosen a general e-commerce marketplace because it offers diverse products at competitive prices, catering to a broad audience without the need for urgent delivery or high-value items. Unlike Q-commerce, which focuses on instant delivery, and rental marketplaces, which handle expensive items, general e-commerce is easier to manage logistically and provides a more straightforward approach for this project.
🌟 Step 2: Business Goals

Many people face challenges in finding an affordable and reliable platform for their everyday shopping needs. My marketplace solves this by offering:

Middle-income households and individuals looking for convenient and cost-effective shopping options.

What Sets It Apart:
